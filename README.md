# RiskLab Summer 2019 Projects

Hello, welcome to a consolidated page background reading on each of RiskLab's 2019 Summer research projects.

## Generalizing the Market Crisis & the 1/N Asset-Allocation Paper - Classical Finance Approach

1. The document entitled “original” is the Professor Seco's original paper we want to generalize. There’s several different possibilities for how one can generalize the paper. 
2. One approach that has been quite successful here at RiskLab has been using PCA or generalizations of PCA Analysis to uncover inter-dependencies as both a portfolio optimization and as a metric for switching between optimal portfolios. The other two documents explain this possible generalization.

## Mathematical Theory of Exotic, Volatile, & Fragmented Markets - Inspired by Crypto 

1. The first two documents, “Asset Pricing” and then “Pricing” are from Professor Seco’s APM466 lectures. The first is the discrete case, second is the continuous case. 
2. John Hull’s textbook (Options, Future, etc.) is the standard industry text that one is given to review concepts, especially in “trading” positions. I would recommend the introduction and the option sections for a practical/real-life-conceptual background.
3. Finally, on the more rigorous side, you have Turner - he summarizes the most critical aspects of the basic Black-Scholes framework.
4. Then, I recommend simply checking out the wiki page for Asian options - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_option

If possible, I’d say the critical ideas to understand are: What are options in general, discrete options pricing, how Black Scholes is derived & it’s connection to the heat equation, and what’s the ideas behind Asian Options.

5. As for background in stochastic calculus, Shreve is quite standard (and also has a small chapter on Asian options): http://efinance.org.cn/cn/FEshuo/stochastic.pdf

## Cross-Currency Optimal Hedging

1. Each document explains the problem at hand and some of the critical things to consider.

## Financial Embeddings

1. Explanation of the transformer architecture: http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html
2. Colah's blog - great place to start for explaining some of the more common models: http://colah.github.io/ -Check out the topology of neural networks post specifically, really does a great job of explaining the manifold connection.
3. Aside from that, check out PyTorch if you aren't familiar.

## ESG

1. Great explanation of the transformer model: http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html
2. Blog on multi-label classification with the BERT model (latest state of the art for NLP, based on the Transformer): https://medium.com/huggingface/multi-label-text-classification-using-bert-the-mighty-transformer-69714fa3fb3d
3. Nice tutorial for using CNNs; this approach is kind of dated but does a good job going through the process: https://machinelearningmastery.com/best-practices-document-classification-deep-learning/

## Reverse Engineering ML Models
